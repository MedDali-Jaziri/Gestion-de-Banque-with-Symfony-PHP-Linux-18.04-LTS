# Bank management in Symfony Framework
<h5>Introduction:</h5>
 <p>We want to create an application that allows you to manage bank accounts.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Each account is defined with a code, a balance and a creation date.</li>
  <li>A current account is an account that also has an overdraft.</li>
  <li>A savings account is an account that also has an interest rate.</li>
  <li>Each account belongs to a client.</li>
  <li>Each client is defined by their code and name</li>
  <li>Each account can undergo several operations.</li>
  <li>There are two types of transaction: Payment and Withdrawal</li>
  <li>An operation is defined by a number, a date and an amount.</li>
</ul>
<h5>The main objectives:</h5>
